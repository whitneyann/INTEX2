<h3>Introduction</h3>
Thanks for choosing FOMO (“FOMO”, “we”, “us”, “our”). By signing up or otherwise using the FOMO service, websites, and software applications (together, the “FOMO Service” or “Service”), or accessing any content or material that is made available by FOMO through the Service (the “Content”) you are entering into a binding contract with FOMO USA Inc. The FOMO Service also includes the FOMO Support Community as further described in the FOMO Support Community section.
The FOMO Service includes social and interactive features. Use of the FOMO Service relies on several technical requirements.
Your agreement with us includes these Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”) and our Privacy Policy. (The Terms, Privacy Policy, and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section, are referred to together as the “Agreements”.) If you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the effective version of the Agreements can be found on FOMO’s website. You acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them. If you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the FOMO Service or consume any Content.
Please read the Agreements carefully. They cover important information about FOMO Services provided to you and any charges, taxes, and fees we bill you. The Agreements include information about future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy information, a class action waiver, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.
Any information that you provided during sign-up can be corrected during the sign-up process by returning to the previous screens and correcting erroneous information.
In order to use the FOMO Service and access the Content, you need to (1) be 18 or older, or be 13 or older and have your parent or guardian’s consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) be resident in the United States. You also promise that any registration information that you submit to FOMO is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.
<h3>Changes to the Agreements</h3>
Occasionally we may, in our discretion, make changes to the Agreements. When we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email. In some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes. Please therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully. If you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate the Agreements by contacting us through the Customer Service contact form.
<h3>Enjoying FOMO</h3>
Here’s some information about all the ways you can enjoy FOMO.
<h3>Our Services & Paid Subscriptions</h3>
FOMO provides streaming services offering a selection of music and other content. Certain FOMO services are provided to you free-of-charge. Other FOMO services require payment before you can access them. The FOMO services that may be accessed after payment are currently referred to as the “Premium Service” and the “Unlimited Service” (together, the “Paid Subscriptions”). The FOMO service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service”. You can learn more about our services by visiting our website.
The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users. We will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services. If you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service. Note that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.
3.2 Codes and other pre-paid offers
If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of FOMO for access to a Paid Subscription (“Code”), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.
3.3 Trials
From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”). FOMO reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to determine your eligibility for a Trial, and, subject to applicable laws, to withdraw or to modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the greatest extent permitted under the law.
For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial. AT THE END OF SUCH TRIALS, WE MAY AUTOMATICALLY START TO CHARGE YOU FOR THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION ON THE FIRST DAY FOLLOWING THE END OF THE TRIAL, ON A RECURRING MONTHLY BASIS. BY PROVIDING YOUR PAYMENT DETAILS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE TRIAL, YOU AGREE TO THIS CHARGE USING SUCH PAYMENT DETAILS. IF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH YOUR FOMO ACCOUNT’S SUBSCRIPTION PAGE OR TERMINATE YOUR FOMO ACCOUNT BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL. IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO CONTINUE TO BE CHARGED ON A RECURRING MONTHLY BASIS, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH YOUR FOMO ACCOUNT’S SUBSCRIPTION PAGE OR TERMINATE YOUR FOMO ACCOUNT BEFORE THE END OF THE RECURRING MONTHLY PERIOD. PAID SUBSCRIPTIONS CANNOT BE TERMINATED BEFORE THE END OF THE PERIOD FOR WHICH YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID, AND EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THESE TERMS, FOMO WILL NOT REFUND ANY FEES THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID. THE LIMITATION SECTION SETS FORTH ADDITIONAL TERMS REGARDING CANCELLATION OF YOUR PAID SUBSCRIPTION.
<h3>Rights we grant you</h3>
The FOMO Service and the Content are the property of FOMO or FOMO's licensors. We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, revocable license to make use of the FOMO Service, and a limited, non-exclusive, revocable license to make personal, non-commercial, entertainment use of the Content (the “License”). This License shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or FOMO. You promise and agree that you are using the Content for your own personal, non-commercial, entertainment use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the FOMO Service or the Content.
The FOMO software applications and the Content are licensed, not sold, to you, and FOMO and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the FOMO software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, and/or other relevant devices (“Devices”).
All FOMO trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the FOMO brand (“FOMO Brand Features”) are the sole property of FOMO or its licensors. The Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any FOMO Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.
You agree to abide by our User guidelines and not to use the FOMO Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements. Except for the rights expressly granted to you in these Agreements, FOMO grants no right, title, or interest to you in the FOMO Service or Content.
Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the FOMO Service are licensed to you either under the Agreements or under the relevant third party software library’s license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.
<h3>Third Party Applications</h3>
The FOMO Service is integrated with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) to make available content, products, and/or services to you. These Third Party Applications may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies. You understand and agree that FOMO does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third Party Applications.
<h3>User-Generated Content</h3>
FOMO users may post, upload, and/or contribute (“post”) content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”). For the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to the FOMO Support Community as well as any other part of the FOMO Service.
You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on FOMO, (1) you have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by FOMO as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements, applicable law, or the intellectual property (including without limitation copyright), publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by FOMO or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from such individual or entity.
FOMO may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content. In all cases, FOMO reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including but not limited to, User Content that, in FOMO’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements. FOMO may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party. Removal or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.
You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post. FOMO is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content. YOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST FOMO RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD FOMO HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.
<h3>Rights you grant us</h3>
In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the FOMO Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same. In any part of the FOMO Service, the Content you view, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including agreements with third parties. Some Content licensed, provided to or otherwise made available by FOMO (e.g. podcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content. In such cases, FOMO will make such Content available to you unmodified.
If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to FOMO in connection with the FOMO Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize FOMO to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you. Feedback is considered a type of User Content.
You grant FOMO a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual (or, in jurisdictions where this is not permitted, for a term equal to the duration of the Agreements plus twenty (20) years), irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g. perform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created. Aside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content. Where applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive any “moral rights” (or the equivalent under applicable law) such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.
